irongate - a rusty SSH scan blocker

  irongate is a modern SSH scan blocker for operating systems that
  support kqueue and pf. It monitors the system authentication log
  and adds attacker IP addresses to a pf table after a number of
  login attempts.

  irongate is written in rust, a new memory-safe language; supports
  both IPv4 and IPv6; and uses a count-min sketch to efficiently map
  IP addresses to frequencies.

Installation

  irongate uses a number of rust APIs that have yet to be stabilized
  and so must be built with a version of rust from the nightly release
  channel. The build process is a simple `cargo build --release`.
